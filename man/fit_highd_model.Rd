\title{Construct the 2-D model and lift into high-dimensions}
\usage{
fit_highd_model(highd_data, nldr_data, b1 = 30, q = 0.1, hd_thresh = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{highd_data}{A tibble that contains the high-dimensional data with a unique identifier.}

\item{nldr_data}{A tibble that contains the embedding with a unique identifier.}

\item{b1}{(default: 4) A numeric value representing the number of bins along the x axis.}

\item{q}{(default: 0.1) A numeric value representing the buffer amount as proportion of data range.}

\item{hd_thresh}{(default: 0) A numeric value using to filter high-density hexagons.}
}
\value{
A list containing a list of a tibble contains scaled first and second columns
of NLDR data, and numeric vectors representing the limits of the original NLDR data (\code{nldr_scaled_obj}),
a object that contains hexagonal binning information (\code{hb_obj}),
a tibble with high-dimensional model (\code{model_highd}) and a tibble containing
hexagonal bin centroids in 2-D (\code{model_2d}), and
a tibble that contains the edge information (\code{trimesh_data}).
}
\description{
This function fits a high-dimensional model using hexagonal bins and provides options
to customize the modeling process, including the choice of bin centroids or bin means,
removal of low-density hexagons, and averaging of high-dimensional data.
