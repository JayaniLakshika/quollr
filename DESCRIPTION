Description: This package offers functions to construct a model in 2D
    space from a 2D embedding and then lift it to the high-dimensional
    space. Additionally, it provides tools to visualize the model in 2D
    space and to overlay the fitted model on data using the tour
    technique. Furthermore, it facilitates the generation of summaries of
    high-dimensional distributions. The process is what Hadley Wickham,
    Dianne Cook, and Heike Hofmann (2015) <doi:10.1002/sam.11271> coined
    viewing the “model in the data space”, and the NLDR view would be
    considered viewing the “data in the (NLDR) model space”.
