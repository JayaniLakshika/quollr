Description: The `quollr` package offers functions to construct a model in 2D space from a 2D embedding and then lift it to the high-dimensional space. Additionally, it provides tools to visualize the model in 2D space and to overlay the fitted model on data using the tour technique. Furthermore, it facilitates the generation of summaries of high-dimensional distributions.
