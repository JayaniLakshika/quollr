Description: Questioning how a high-dimensional object looks in low-dimensions. With 'quollr', you can create linked interactive graphics that facilitate the exploration and analysis of high-dimensional datasets. This powerful tool allows you to diagnose the quality of dimension reduction techniques and gain insights into the global structure of your data through interactive tours. A complete description of the method is discussed in paper.
