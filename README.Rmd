The `quollr` package offers functions to construct a model in 2D space from a 2D embedding and then lift it to the high-dimensional space. Additionally, it provides tools to visualize the model in 2D space and to overlay the fitted model on data using the tour technique. Furthermore, it facilitates the generation of summaries of high-dimensional distributions.

<!--For a thorough background and discussion on this work, please read our paper [link to the paper].

## Installation

You can install the released version of `quollr` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("quollr") 
```
-->

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("JayaniLakshika/quollr")
```

## Usage

Our approach involves dividing the high-dimensional data set into two parts: a training set to construct the model and a test set to generate model summaries. To implement our approach, first we use a 2D embedding data set as the initial point. The output of our algorithm is a tour that displays the model overlaid on high-dimensional data. Our algorithm comprises two main phases:(1) generate the model in the 2D space, and (2) generate the model in the high-dimensional space. This methodology is available in this package.
