The `quollr` package provide functions to construct a model in the 2D space based on 2D embedding and then lifts to the high dimensional space. The package also provides a visualization that integrates this model with high dimensional data using the tour technique. For a thorough background and discussion on this work, please read our paper [link to the paper].
