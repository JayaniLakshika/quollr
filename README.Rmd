# quollr: questioning how a high-dimensional object looks in low-dimensions using r 
<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" alt="" />

quollr constructs a model in the 2D space and then lifts to the high dimensional space. The package integrates this model with high dimensional data using the tour technique. For further insights and details, readers can refer to the associated paper available at [link to the paper].
