```{r setup}
library(quollr)
```

quollr constructs low-dimensional manifolds by combining Non-Linear Dimension Reduction (NLDR), hexagonal binning, and triangulation techniques, enabling accurate high-dimensional data representations. The package integrates these manifolds with original data using the tour technique, while also offering tools for generating simulated data sets for comprehensive exploration.
